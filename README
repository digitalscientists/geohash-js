SUMMARY
Slimmed down version of David Troy's Geohash for use in Appcelerator iPhone Applications
Will accept lat/long dictionary and resolution:

plotGeoHash({lat: 33.806024, lng: -84.342295}, 5);

And will plot bounding boxes as in Troy's demo at http://openlocation.org/geohash/geohash-js/ if a Titanium mapview has been created as var mapview.

A screenshot of the final product is included in this project here: https://github.com/digitalscientists/geohash-js/blob/master/geohash_grid.png Note than annotations are not created automatically, but are easily built using the final_hashes array. This will be integrated in future updates.
