SUMMARY
Slimmed down version of David Troy's Geohash for use in Appcelerator iPhone Applications
Will accept lat/long dictionary and resolution:

geo = new GeohashClass();
geo.map = Titanium.Map.createView({
  //Your settings
});
geo.plotGeoHash({lat: 33.806024, lng: -84.342295}, 5);

And will plot bounding boxes as in Troy's demo at http://openlocation.org/geohash/geohash-js/ if a Titanium mapview has been set. Annotations to mark the geohashes used can be done with:

geo.plotGridHashes();
